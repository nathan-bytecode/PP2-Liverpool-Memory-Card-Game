# Liverpool Memory Card Game

This project is a memory card game. The user's aim is to match all 6 pairs of Liverpool football players. A timer is set to a start button to test how fast the user completes the task. A move counter is also on display.

This project is aimed to target all who are Liverpool Football Club fans and like to have fun.
